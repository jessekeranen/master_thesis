In contrast to previously developed tests, a wide variety of accuracy measures can be used (in particular, the loss function need not be quadratic and need not even be symmetric), and forecast errors can be non-Gaussian, nonzero mean, serially correlated, and contemporaneously correlated. Asymptotic and exact finite-sample tests are proposed, evaluated, and illustrated.},

This effect persists after controlling for the well known determinants of stock returns like the firm-size, book-to-market ratio and the firm beta. Unlike Eleswarapu and Reinganum (1993, Journal of Financial Economics, 34, 373–386), this paper finds that the liquidity effect is not restricted to the month of January alone and is prevalent throughout the year. The evidence supports Amihud and Mendelson's (1986) notion of liquidity premium and establishes its role in the overall cross section of stock returns.}

Also, volatility exhibits significant incremental power beyond transaction costs and investor sophistication measures in explaining cross-sectional variation in the B/M effect.

However, in multiple factor comparison tests, no enhanced momentum strategy emerges as consistently superior. Finally, cross-country analyses relate momentum and the two constant volatility-scaled momentum returns to market dynamics, whereas dynamic-scaled momentum is significantly less affected, suggesting a reduced sensitivity to time-varying investor overconfidence.}

We test whether empirical asset pricing models capture the value and momentum patterns in international average returns and whether asset pricing seems to be integrated across the four regions.

The five-factor model׳s main problem is its failure to capture the low average returns on small stocks whose returns behave like those of firms that invest a lot despite low profitability. The model׳s performance is not sensitive to the way its factors are defined. With the addition of profitability and investment factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for describing average returns in the sample we examine.}

In the model, riskier firms (i.e., firms with a higher correlation between cash flows and the aggregate shock) are more likely to use costly external funding to finance their growth option exercises and have higher optimal savings. This precautionary savings motive implies a positive relation between expected equity returns and cash holdings. In addition, this positive relation is stronger for firms with less valuable growth options. Using a data set of US pubic companies, I find evidence consistent with the model's predictions.},

We document important issues of coverage, classification, and data integrity and find that naive use of TDS data can have a large impact on economic inferences. We show that after careful screening of the TDS data, inferences drawn from TDS data are similar to those drawn from CRSP. We illustrate the importance of the screens we develop using U.S. TDS data by applying the screens to TDS data from four European equity markets.},

@article{Fieberg,
	abstract = {We compare the performance of the linear regression model, which is the current standard in science and practice for cross-sectional stock return forecasting, with that of machine learning methods, i.e., penalized linear models, support vector regression, random forests, gradient boosted trees and neural networks. Our analysis is based on monthly data on nearly 12,000 individual stocks from 16 European economies over almost 30 years from 1990 to 2019. We find that the prediction of stock returns can be decisively improved through machine learning methods. The outperformance of individual (combined) machine learning models over the benchmark model is approximately 0.6{\%} (0.7{\%}) per month for the full cross-section of stocks. Furthermore, we find no model breakdowns, which suggests that investors do not incur additional risk from using machine learning methods compared to the traditional benchmark approach. Additionally, the superior performance of machine learning models is not due to substantially higher portfolio turnover. Further analyses suggest that machine learning models generate their added value particularly in bear markets when the average investor tends to lose money. Our results indicate that future research and practice should make more intensive use of machine learning techniques with respect to stock return prediction.},

There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two bond-market factors, related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except for low-grade corporates, the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns. Most important, the five factors seem to explain average returns on stocks and bonds.},

The theoretical basis of the tests is the "two-parameter" portfolio model and models of market equilibrium derived from the two-parameter portfolio model. We cannot reject the hypothesis of these models that the pricing of common stocks reflects the attempts of risk-averse investors to hold portfolios that are "efficient" in terms of expected value and dispersion of return. Moreover, the observed "fair game" properties of the coefficients and residuals of the risk-return regressions are consistent with an "efficient capital market"--that is, a market where prices of securities},

Our results indicate that in the Nordic stock markets, the value anomaly offered excess returns in the 1993--2017 sample period only when small stocks were a part of the portfolio, whereas the momentum effect is strong and significant, irrespective of size. Interestingly, our findings also indicate that the negative correlation between value and momentum seems to be driven by growth stocks: Winner stocks that are value stocks generated 1.66\% per month on average, whereas winner stocks that are growth stocks exhibit virtually the same average payoff. On the other hand, the spread between value and growth stocks that are loser stocks is on average 0.97\% per month. },

@article{Drobetz,
	abstract = {This paper evaluates the predictive performance of machine learning methods in forecasting European stock returns. Compared to a linear benchmark model, interactions and nonlinear effects help improve the predictive performance. But machine learning models must be adequately trained and tuned to overcome the high dimensionality problem and to avoid overfitting. Across all machine learning methods, the most important predictors are based on price trends and fundamental signals from valuation ratios. However, the models exhibit substantial variation in statistical predictive performance that translate into pronounced differences in economic profitability. The return and risk measures of long-only trading strategies indicate that machine learning models produce sizeable gains relative to our benchmark. Neural networks perform best, also after accounting for transaction costs. A classification-based portfolio formation, utilizing a support vector machine that avoids estimating stock-level expected returns, performs even better than the neural network architecture.},

Furthermore, significant net returns can be achieved when accounting for transaction costs, short-selling constraints, and limiting our investment universe to big stocks only.}
