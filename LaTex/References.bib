abstract = {This paper provides an alternative test of Amihud and Mendelson's (1986, Journal of Financial Economics, 8, 31–35) model using the turnover rate (number of shares traded as a fraction of the number of shares outstanding) as a proxy for liquidity. The evidence suggests that liquidity plays a significant role in explaining the cross-sectional variation in stock returns. This effect persists after controlling for the well known determinants of stock returns like the firm-size, book-to-market ratio and the firm beta. Unlike Eleswarapu and Reinganum (1993, Journal of Financial Economics, 34, 373–386), this paper finds that the liquidity effect is not restricted to the month of January alone and is prevalent throughout the year. The evidence supports Amihud and Mendelson's (1986) notion of liquidity premium and establishes its role in the overall cross section of stock returns.}

It is found that smaller firms have had higher risk adjusted returns, on average, than larger firms. This ‘size effect’ has been in existence for at least forty years and is evidence that the capital asset pricing model is misspecified. The size effect is not linear in the market value; the main effect occurs for very small firms while there is little difference in return between average sized and large firms. It is not known whether size per se is responsible for the effect or whether size is just a proxy for one or more true unknown factors correlated with size.}

The B/M effect for high volatility stocks exceeds that for the low volatility stocks in 20 of the 22 sample years. Also, volatility exhibits significant incremental power beyond transaction costs and investor sophistication measures in explaining cross-sectional variation in the B/M effect. These findings are consistent with the Shleifer and Vishny (1997) thesis that risk associated with the volatility of arbitrage returns deters arbitrage activity and is an important reason why the B/M effect exists.}

Nearness to the 52-week high dominates and improves upon the forecasting power of past returns (both individual and industry returns) for future returns. Future returns forecast using the 52-week high do not reverse in the long run. These results indicate that short-term momentum and long-term reversals are largely separate phenomena, which presents a challenge to current theory that models these aspects of security returns as integrated components of the market's response to news.},

Consistent with theory, we find that stocks with high sensitivities to innovations in aggregate volatility have low average returns. Stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility relative to the Fama and French (1993, Journal of Financial Economics 25, 2349) model have abysmally low average returns. This phenomenon cannot be explained by exposure to aggregate volatility risk. Size, book-to-market, momentum, and liquidity effects cannot account for either the low average returns earned by stocks with high exposure to systematic volatility risk or for the low average returns of stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility.},

However, in multiple factor comparison tests, no enhanced momentum strategy emerges as consistently superior. Finally, cross-country analyses relate momentum and the two constant volatility-scaled momentum returns to market dynamics, whereas dynamic-scaled momentum is significantly less affected, suggesting a reduced sensitivity to time-varying investor overconfidence.}

We test whether empirical asset pricing models capture the value and momentum patterns in international average returns and whether asset pricing seems to be integrated across the four regions.

The five-factor model׳s main problem is its failure to capture the low average returns on small stocks whose returns behave like those of firms that invest a lot despite low profitability. The model׳s performance is not sensitive to the way its factors are defined. With the addition of profitability and investment factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for describing average returns in the sample we examine.}

In the model, riskier firms (i.e., firms with a higher correlation between cash flows and the aggregate shock) are more likely to use costly external funding to finance their growth option exercises and have higher optimal savings. This precautionary savings motive implies a positive relation between expected equity returns and cash holdings. In addition, this positive relation is stronger for firms with less valuable growth options. Using a data set of US pubic companies, I find evidence consistent with the model's predictions.},

Our analysis is based on monthly data on nearly 12,000 individual stocks from 16 European economies over almost 30 years from 1990 to 2019. We find that the prediction of stock returns can be decisively improved through machine learning methods. The outperformance of individual (combined) machine learning models over the benchmark model is approximately 0.6{\%} (0.7{\%}) per month for the full cross-section of stocks. Furthermore, we find no model breakdowns, which suggests that investors do not incur additional risk from using machine learning methods compared to the traditional benchmark approach. Additionally, the superior performance of machine learning models is not due to substantially higher portfolio turnover. Further analyses suggest that machine learning models generate their added value particularly in bear markets when the average investor tends to lose money. Our results indicate that future research and practice should make more intensive use of machine learning techniques with respect to stock return prediction.},

But machine learning models must be adequately trained and tuned to overcome the high dimensionality problem and to avoid overfitting. Across all machine learning methods, the most important predictors are based on price trends and fundamental signals from valuation ratios. However, the models exhibit substantial variation in statistical predictive performance that translate into pronounced differences in economic profitability. The return and risk measures of long-only trading strategies indicate that machine learning models produce sizeable gains relative to our benchmark. Neural networks perform best, also after accounting for transaction costs. A classification-based portfolio formation, utilizing a support vector machine that avoids estimating stock-level expected returns, performs even better than the neural network architecture.},

These forecasts mimic how an investor could, in real time, combine many firm characteristics to obtain a composite estimate of a stockâ€™s expected return. Empirically, the forecasts vary substantially across stocks and have strong predictive power for actual returns. For example, using ten-year rolling estimates of Fama- MacBeth slopes and a cross-sectional model with 15 firm characteristics (all based on low-frequency data), the expected-return estimates have a cross-sectional standard deviation of 0.87\% monthly and a predictive slope for future monthly returns of 0.74, with a standard error of 0.07.},

	abstract = {This article examines the added value of combining price momentum with various value strategies in the Finnish stock market during the period 1993--2008. The results show that taking into account the price momentum of value stocks enhances portfolio performance. Among the best-performing portfolios, the performance improvement resulting from the inclusion of a momentum indicator is the greatest for value portfolios that are formed on the basis of three-composite value measures. The risk-adjusted performance of the best value winner portfolios can be enhanced further by following the 130/30 long-short strategy. The best long-short portfolios significantly outperform the corresponding long-only value winner portfolios and more than double the average return of the stock market coupled with the volatility decrease.},

	abstract = {This paper compares various machine learning models to predict the cross-section of emerging market stock returns. We document that allowing for non-linearities and interactions leads to economically and statistically superior out-of-sample returns compared to traditional linear models. Although we find that both linear and machine learning models show higher predictability for stocks associated with higher limits to arbitrage, we also show that this effect is less pronounced for non-linear models. Furthermore, significant net returns can be achieved when accounting for transaction costs, short-selling constraints, and limiting our investment universe to big stocks only.},
